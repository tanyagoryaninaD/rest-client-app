# REST Client

## Project Overview

The final RS School React 2025Q3 task.

This web application is built on Next.js with Material UI, designed for testing REST APIs. It includes authentication, a main client for requests, history, variables, and common interface elements. The application is oriented towards users who want to quickly test APIs without complex tools.

## General Architecture

- Sign In / Sign Up: Pages for user authentication and registration.
- REST Client: Interface for creating and sending HTTP requests.
- History and Analytics: Tracking and analysis of executed requests.
- Variables: Management of dynamic variables for requests.

## Getting Started Locally

### Required software

- Currently version **Node.js: v22.17.1**

### Installation

To use the application follow these steps:

- clone the repository.
- install the dependencies with npm i.
- start the local server using npm run dev.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tanyagoryaninaD/rest-client-app
cd rest-client-app
npm install
npm run dev
```
